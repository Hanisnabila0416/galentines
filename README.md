About the Project**
**This website was built as a digital invitation and activity hub for a private Galentine’s event.
Instead of sending a traditional card, I wanted to create something interactive, aesthetic, and memorable. The site reflects the overall concept of the celebration: a candlelit long-table dinner with florals, films, and cookie decorating.
The visual direction draws from romantic vintage settings, layered textures, thrifted elements, and soft lighting. The intention was to create something intimate and personal — almost like a digital love letter to close friends.
